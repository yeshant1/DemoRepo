This project is a React + TypeScript online course platform migrated from Angular. Match the features, structure, and backend API endpoints as in the original Angular project. Use React Router, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Axios, and organize code for authentication, role-based routing, course management, purchase/payment (Razorpay), and error pages.
